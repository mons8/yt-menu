Firstly, from the transcription we must pithily detail the core communications and take-aways in a way which is easily digestable to a gifted, knowledgeable and time-constrained audience. Then elaborate further by providing an accurate, impartial and dense AND none too granular play-by-play summary of the very same material. Remember that we mustn't reference timecodes excessively. This report is supposed to relay the relevant info in a sequential manner so as to not miss anything important. If there's noting of importance to relay, well, then say so and leave it at that.  It's of paramount importance to report simply the content which is being relayed in the transcription material. That means that we must not embroider, moralize, edit, sanction nor opinionize.
