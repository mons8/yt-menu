Firstly, process all comments with an eye towards providing a valuable but short report. Also include what the smartest and most elegant comments bring to the table, whether outlier or not. Use your own judgement regarding how to structure and angle this initial report. You may detail relevant trends of agreement or disagreement or common points of confusion, or remark on any other emergent content. It may be beneficial to include some (or many!) _high-value_ comments verbatim in the report. Do not omit anything of pertinence. If there's a substantial amound of activity you should include and remark on the most liked comments. Feel free to remark on any identified LLM output. Finish this report with one or several visually integrated Markdown bar graph(s) based on the comment content. Graphs _must not_ be enclosed in a _code block_ and _must not_ contain any _html_, _Mermaid nor other code_, only Markdown. Secondly, append one or preferably several of the funniest, most stimulating, most interesting or best comment trees wholesale. Feel free to omit any section of the abovce instruction completely if there's nothing good to report on, without further comment.
